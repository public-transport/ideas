# ideas for public transport

**How can we make [public transport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_transport) more comfortable, more accessible, more transparent?** In short, how can we make it *better*?

This is a meta-repo to collect and discuss long-term ideas and projects that try to answer this question. We use [the issue tracker](https://github.com/public-transport/ideas/issues) for that. It is also intended as a contact point for newcomers to ask questions or dig in further.
